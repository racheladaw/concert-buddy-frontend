# Concert Buddy

Concert Buddy allows a user to sign up and view upcoming concerts in their city. Concerts can be saved and viewed on a separate page.

This app utilizes React and Redux on the front-end and a Rails API back-end with a PostgreSQL database. It is meant to be used alongside the Concert Buddy Rails API found [here](https://github.com/racheladaw/concert-buddy-app-backend).
